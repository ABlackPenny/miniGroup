- Weekly task:

- - Learn git by using terminal(Mac)/cmd(Windows) and markdown basics.
  - Clone this repository to your computer and make one commit successfully.



We can discuss _everything_ here. 



Since we are all here on GitHub, our primary goal is to polish up our *coding* skills by practising and sharing. Please speak out your minds and bring forward any suggestions that you think will benefit this goal.



Here are some of my thoughs. First, we can organize this repository into three main sections---first, the sharing section; second, the discussion section; third, private sections. By sharing resources such as booklists, websites and ebooks, we can get access to more valuable information and learn from others' experience.  Second, the discussion is a place where we can discuss our course lectures, tutorial and lab problems. Third, the private section is a temporary place where we keep our code snippets for later reviews. By organizing folders this way, hopefully we can have an efficient way to get what we want and help each other.



Therefore, the first step is to *clone* this repository to your computer and create a specific folder just for yourself. Add anything you want in this folder. 



We can schedule our activity here weekly (the very beginning schedule is an example). Or we can study and work on a book together by sharing and contributing study notes here. Or we can post code snippets here for each other to review. Anything is welcome.
